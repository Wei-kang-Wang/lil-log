# Introduction

The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the automatic discovery of regularities in data through the use of computer algorithms and with the use of these regularities 
to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.

Consider the example of recognizing handwritten digits. Each digit corresponds to a $28 \times 28$ pixel image and so can be represented by a vector **x** comprising $784$ real 
numbers. The goal is to build a machine that will take such a vector **x** as input and that will produce the identity of $0,...,9$ as the output. This is a nontrivial problem due 
to the wide variability of handwriting. It could be tackled using handcrafted rules or heuristics for distinguishing the digits based on the shapes of the strokes, but in practice such 
an approach leads to proliferation of rules and of exceptions to the rules and so on, and invariably gives poor results.

Far better results can be obtained by adopting a machine learning approach in which a large set of $N$ digits $\left\{ **x_1,...,x_N** \right\}$ called a *training set* is used to 
tune the parameters of an adaptive model. The categories of the digits in the training set are known in advance, typically by inspecting them individually and hand-labelling them. 
We can express the category of a digit using *target vector* **t**, which represents the identity of the corresponding digit. Note that there is one such target vector **t** 
for each digit image **x**.
